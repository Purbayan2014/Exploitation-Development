This repository is related to my daily progress on learning how to find exploits and how to develop them.

# What is Exploit Development?

As usual within the security industry, the terms are made up and no one uses them consistently. Exploit development as it is used here is about the development of scripts or programs that can take advantage of (exploit) memory corruption vulnerabilities in software.

This is opposed to exploits that might take advantage of higher-level vulnerabilities such as those seen in general application security such as web-applications or mobile applications.
